# Pandas Interactive Cheat Sheets

Pandas Interactive Cheat Sheets are Jupyter Notebooks which contains Python code snippets so this track needs primarily knowledge of the Python Programming Language which can be found [here](https://github.com/mhmaem/python_university/tree/master/01_python_beginner_interactive_cheatsheets) 

## For whom this track?
 - New comers to the Data Science world
 - Students who need to utilize python for simulation and so on
 - Data analysts and scientists who need to utilize the huge data centeric Python echo system
 - Data analysts and scientists who want to review the package syntax and tricks for exam or interview

## Why one more learning track?
 - More comprehensive cheat sheets
 - Actively updated
 - Learning while trying 
 - No need to preinstall any software to start learning (utilizing **[Google Colab Platform](https://colab.research.google.com)**)
 - All what is needed is a modern browser, so you can even learn through your phone (utilizing **[Google Colab Platform](https://colab.research.google.com)**)

## How to use this track material?
The main advantage of this track that it gives you the ability to learn while trying interactively, you can learn from the track's notebooks through many ways such like:
 - **Recommended Option**, at the top of each notebook there will be link open latest version directly  on **[Google Colab Platform](https://colab.research.google.com)** , that will allow you to run the original code snippets and even modify it before running it
 - Download and play the notebooks on any Python stack that supports Jupyter as an example **[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)** 
 - **Least Recommended Option**, review the notebooks on read only mood via github, but the notebooks will not be interactive in that option
